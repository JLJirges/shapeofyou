                <p>
                    'SHAPE OF YOU' is a platform for people who would like to live a healthy or healthier lifestyle, to
                    lose weight or to build muscles and stay fit.

                <p class="question">Can I get the money back of an event's ticket in case I can't attend?</p>
                <p>
                    We are sorry to tell you, that it's not possible to give a ticket back or to get a refund. What is
                    possible is to give the ticket to another person, even if this person is no (active) member of
                    'SHAPE OF YOU'.

                <p>
                    We will cry, our hearts will break, but we will accept your desicion without making a szene. You are
                    free to go same as you are free to come back whenever you feel like it!
                </p>
